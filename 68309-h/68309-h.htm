<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_1"></a>[1]</span></p>

<p class="p4">To-day I wish to speak to you on one
feature of our national foreign policy and
one feature of our national domestic
policy.</p>
</div>

<p>The Monroe Doctrine is not a part of
international law. But it is the fundamental
feature of our entire foreign policy
so far as the Western Hemisphere is concerned,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
and it has more and more been
meeting with recognition abroad. The
reason why it is meeting with this recognition
is because we have not allowed it
to become fossilized, but have adapted our
construction of it to meet the growing,
changing needs of this hemisphere. Fossilization,
of course, means death, whether
to an individual, a government, or a doctrine.</p>

<p>It is out of the question to claim a right
and yet shirk the responsibility for exercising<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
that right. When we announce a
policy such as the Monroe Doctrine we
thereby commit ourselves to accepting the
consequences of the policy, and these consequences
from time to time alter.</p>

<p>Let us look for a moment at what the
Monroe Doctrine really is. It forbids the
territorial encroachment of non-American
powers on American soil. Its purpose is
partly to secure this Nation against seeing
great military powers obtain new footholds
in the Western Hemisphere, and partly to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
secure to our fellow-republics south of us
the chance to develop along their own
lines without being oppressed or conquered
by non-American powers. As we
have grown more and more powerful our
advocacy of this doctrine has been received
with more and more respect; but
what has tended most to give the doctrine
standing among the nations is our
growing willingness to show that we not
only mean what we say and are prepared
to back it up, but that we mean to recognize<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
our obligations to foreign peoples no
less than to insist upon our own rights.</p>

<p>We can not permanently adhere to
the Monroe Doctrine unless we succeed
in making it evident in the first place
that we do not intend to treat it in any
shape or way as an excuse for aggrandizement
on our part at the expense of the
republics to the south of us; second, that
we do not intend to permit it to be used
by any of these republics as a shield to
protect that republic from the consequences<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
of its own misdeeds against
foreign nations; third, that inasmuch as
by this doctrine we prevent other nations
from interfering on this side of the water,
we shall ourselves in good faith try to
help those of our sister republics, which
need such help, upward toward peace and
order.</p>

<p>As regards the first point we must
recognize the fact that in some South
American countries there has been much
suspicion lest we should interpret the Monroe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
Doctrine in some way inimical to their
interests. Now let it be understood once
for all that no just and orderly government
on this continent has anything to fear from
us. There are certain of the republics
south of us which have already reached
such a point of stability, order, and prosperity
that they are themselves, although
as yet hardly consciously, among the
guarantors of this doctrine. No stable and
growing American republic wishes to see
some great non-American military power<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
acquire territory in its neighborhood.
It is the interest of all of us on this continent
that no such event should occur,
and in addition to our own Republic there
are now already republics in the regions
south of us which have reached a point of
prosperity and power that enables them
to be considerable factors in maintaining
this doctrine which is so much to the
advantage of all of us. It must be understood
that under no circumstances will
the United States use the Monroe Doctrine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
as a cloak for territorial aggression.
Should any of our neighbors, no matter
how turbulent, how disregardful of our
rights, finally get into such a position that
the utmost limits of our forbearance are
reached, all the people south of us may
rest assured that no action will ever be
taken save what is absolutely demanded
by our self-respect; that this action will
not take the form of territorial aggrandizement
on our part, and that it will
only be taken at all with the most extreme<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
reluctance and not without having exhausted
every effort to avert it.</p>

<p>As to the second point, if a republic to
the south of us commits a tort against a
foreign nation, such, for instance, as wrongful
action against the persons of citizens
of that nation, then the Monroe Doctrine
does not force us to interfere to prevent
punishment of the tort, save to see that the
punishment does not directly or indirectly
assume the form of territorial occupation of
the offending country. The case is more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
difficult when the trouble comes from the
failure to meet contractual obligations.
Our own Government has always refused
to enforce such contractual obligations on
behalf of its citizens by the appeal to arms.
It is much to be wished that all foreign
governments would take the same view.
But at present this country would certainly
not be willing to go to war to prevent a
foreign government from collecting a just
debt or to back up some one of our sister
republics in a refusal to pay just debts;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
and the alternative may in any case prove
to be that we shall ourselves undertake to
bring about some arrangement by which
so much as is possible of the just obligations
shall be paid. Personally I should
always prefer to see this country step in and
put through such an arrangement rather
than let any foreign country undertake it.</p>

<p>I do not want to see any foreign
power take possession permanently or
temporarily of the custom-houses of an
American republic in order to enforce<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
its obligations, and the alternative may at
any time be that we shall be forced to do
so ourselves.</p>

<p>Finally, and what is in my view,
really the most important thing of all, it
is our duty, so far as we are able, to try
to help upward our weaker brothers.
Just as there has been a gradual growth
of the ethical element in the relations of
one individual to another, so that with all
the faults of our Christian civilization it
yet remains true that we are, no matter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
how slowly, more and more coming to
recognize the duty of bearing one
another’s burdens, similarly I believe that
the ethical element is by degrees entering
into the dealings of one nation with
another.</p>

<p>Under strain of emotion caused by
sudden disaster this feeling is very evident.
A famine or a plague in one country
brings much sympathy and some
assistance from other countries. Moreover,
we are now beginning to recognize<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
that weaker peoples have a claim upon
us, even when the appeal is made, not to
our emotions by some sudden calamity,
but to our consciences by a long continuing
condition of affairs.</p>

<p>I do not mean to say that nations
have more than begun to approach the
proper relationship one to another, and I
fully recognize the folly of proceeding
upon the assumption that this ideal condition
can now be realized in full—for, in
order to proceed upon such an assumption,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
we would first require some method
of forcing recalcitrant nations to do their
duty, as well as of seeing that they are
protected in their rights.</p>

<p>In the interest of justice, it is as
necessary to exercise the police power
as to show charity and helpful generosity.
But something can even now be done
toward the end in view. That something,
for instance, this Nation has
already done as regards Cuba, and is
now trying to do as regards Santo Domingo.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
There are few things in our history
in which we should take more genuine
pride than the way in which we liberated
Cuba, and then, instead of instantly abandoning
it to chaos, stayed in direction of
the affairs of the island until we had put
it on the right path, and finally gave it
freedom and helped it as it started on the
life of an independent republic.</p>

<p>Santo Domingo has now made an appeal
to us to help it in turn, and not only
every principle of wisdom but every generous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
instinct within us bids us respond
to the appeal. The conditions in Santo
Domingo have for a number of years
grown from bad to worse until recently all
society was on the verge of dissolution.
Fortunately just at this time a wise ruler
sprang up in Santo Domingo, who, with
his colleagues, saw the dangers threatening
their beloved country, and appealed
to the friendship of their great and powerful
neighbor to help them. The immediate
threat came to them in the shape of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
foreign intervention. The previous rulers
of Santo Domingo had recklessly incurred
debts, and owing to her internal disorders
she had ceased to be able
to provide means of paying the debts.
The patience of her foreign creditors had
become exhausted, and at least one foreign
nation was on the point of intervention and
was only prevented from intervening by
the unofficial assurance of this Government
that it would itself strive to help
Santo Domingo in her hour of need. Of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
the debts incurred some were just, while
some were not of a character which really
renders it obligatory on, or proper for,
Santo Domingo to pay them in full. But
she could not pay any of them at
all unless some stability was assured.</p>

<p>Accordingly the Executive Department
of our Government negotiated a treaty
under which we are to try to help the
Dominican people to straighten out their
finances. This treaty is pending before
the Senate, whose consent to it is necessary.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
In the meantime we have
made a temporary arrangement which
will last until the Senate has had
time to take action upon the treaty.
Under this arrangement we see to the honest
administration of the custom-houses,
collecting the revenues, turning over forty-five
per cent to the Government for running
expenses and putting the other fifty-five
per cent into a safe deposit for equitable
division among the various creditors,
whether European or American, accordingly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
as, after investigation, their claims
seem just.</p>

<p>The custom-houses offer well-nigh
the only sources of revenue in Santo
Domingo, and the different revolutions
usually have as their real aim the obtaining
possession of these custom-houses.
The mere fact that we are protecting the
custom-houses and collecting the revenue
with efficiency and honesty has completely
discouraged all revolutionary movement,
while it has already produced such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
an increase in the revenues that the
Government is actually getting more
from the forty-five per cent that we
turn over to it than it got formerly
when it took the entire revenue.
This is enabling the poor harrassed people
of Santo Domingo once more to turn their
attention to industry and to be free from
the curse of interminable revolutionary disturbance.
It offers to all bona fide creditors,
American and European, the only
really good chance to obtain that to which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
they are justly entitled, while it in return
gives to Santo Domingo the only opportunity
of defense against claims which it
ought not to pay—for now if it meets the
views of the Senate we shall ourselves
thoroughly examine all these claims,
whether American or foreign, and see that
none that are improper are paid. Indeed,
the only effective opposition to the treaty
will probably come from dishonest creditors,
foreign and American, and from the
professional revolutionists of the island<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
itself. We have already good reason to
believe that some of the creditors who do
not dare expose their claims to honest
scrutiny are endeavoring to stir up sedition
in the island, and are also endeavoring
to stir up opposition to the treaty both
in Santo Domingo and here, trusting that
in one place or the other it may be possible
to secure either the rejection of the
treaty or else its amendment in such fashion
as to be tantamount to rejection.</p>

<p>Under the course taken, stability and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
order and all the benefits of peace are at
last coming to Santo Domingo, all danger
of foreign intervention has ceased, and
there is at last a prospect that all creditors
will get justice, no more and no less.
If the arrangement is terminated, chaos
will follow; and if chaos follows, sooner or
later this Government may be involved in
serious difficulties with foreign governments
over the island, or else may be
forced itself to intervene in the island in
some unpleasant fashion. Under the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
present arrangement the independence of
the island is scrupulously respected, the
danger of violation of the Monroe Doctrine
by the intervention of foreign powers
vanishes, and the interference of our
Government is minimized, so that we only
act in conjunction with the Santo Domingo
authorities to secure the proper
administration of the customs, and therefore
to secure the payment of just debts
and to secure the Santo Dominican Government
against demands for unjust debts.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
The present method prevents there being
any need of our establishing any kind of
protectorate over the island and gives the
people of Santo Domingo the same chance
to move onward and upward which we
have already given to the people of Cuba.
It will be doubly to our discredit as a
nation if we fail to take advantage of this
chance; for it will be of damage to ourselves,
and, above all, it will be of incalculable
damage to Santo Domingo.
Every consideration of wise policy, and,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
above all, every consideration of large
generosity, bids us meet the request of
Santo Domingo as we are now trying to
meet it.</p>

<p>So much for one feature of our foreign
policy. Now for one feature of our
domestic policy. One of the main
features of our national governmental
policy should be the effort to secure
adequate and effective supervisory and
regulatory control over all great corporations
doing an interstate business.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
Much of the legislation aimed to prevent
the evils connected with the enormous
development of these great corporations
has been ineffective, partly because it
aimed at doing too much, and partly
because it did not confer on the Government
a really efficient method of holding
any guilty corporation to account.
The effort to prevent all restraint of competition,
whether harmful or beneficial, has
been ill-judged; what is needed is not so
much the effort to prevent combination as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
a vigilant and effective control of the combinations
formed, so as to secure just and
equitable dealing on their part alike toward
the public generally, toward their smaller
competitors, and toward the wage-workers
in their employ.</p>

<p>Under the present laws we have in
the last four years accomplished much
that is of substantial value; but the
difficulties in the way have been so great
as to prove that further legislation is
advisable. Many corporations show themselves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
honorably desirous to obey the
law; but, unfortunately, some corporations,
and very wealthy ones at that, exhaust
every effort which can be suggested by
the highest ability, or secured by the
most lavish expenditure of money, to
defeat the purposes of the laws on the
statute books.</p>

<p>Not only the men in control of these
corporations, but the business world generally,
ought to realize that such conduct
is in every way perilous, and constitutes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
a menace to the nation generally, and
especially to the people of great property.</p>

<p>I earnestly believe that this is true of
only a relatively small portion of the very
rich men engaged in handling the largest
corporations in the country; but the
attitude of these comparatively few men
does undoubtedly harm the country, and
above all harm the men of large means,
by the just, but sometimes misguided,
popular indignation to which it gives rise.
The consolidation in the form of what are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
popularly called trusts of corporate interests
of immense value has tended to produce
unfair restraints of trade of an oppressive
character, and these unfair restraints
tend to create great artificial monopolies.
The violations of the law known as the
anti-trust law, which was meant to meet
the conditions thus arising, have more
and more become confined to the larger
combinations, the very ones against whose
policy of monopoly and oppression the
policy of the law was chiefly directed.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
Many of these combinations by secret
methods and by protracted litigation are
still unwisely seeking to avoid the
consequences of their illegal action.
The Government has very properly exercised
moderation in attempting to enforce
the criminal provisions of the statute; but
it has become our conviction that in some
cases, such as that of at least certain of the
beef packers recently indicted in Chicago,
it is impossible longer to show leniency.
Moreover, if the existing law proves to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
inadequate, so that under established rules
of evidence clear violations may not
be readily proved, defiance of the law
must inevitably lead to further legislation.
This legislation may be more drastic
than I would prefer. If so, it must be
distinctly understood that it will be
because of the stubborn determination
of some of the great combinations in
striving to prevent the enforcement of
the law as it stands, by every device,
legal and illegal. Very many of these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
men seem to think that the alternative
is simply between submitting to the
mild kind of governmental control
we advocate and the absolute freedom
to do whatever they think best.
They are greatly in error. Either they
will have to submit to reasonable supervision
and regulation by the national
authorities, or else they will ultimately
have to submit to governmental action of
a far more drastic type. Personally, I
think our people would be most unwise if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
they let any exasperation due to the acts
of certain great corporations drive them
into drastic action, and I should oppose
such action. But the great corporations
are themselves to blame if by their opposition
to what is legal and just they foster
the popular feeling which tells for such
drastic action.</p>

<p>Some great corporations resort to
every technical expedient to render enforcement
of the law impossible, and their
obstructive tactics and refusal to acquiesce<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
in the policy of the law have taxed to the
utmost the machinery of the Department
of Justice. In my judgment Congress
may well inquire whether it should not
seek other means for carrying into effect
the law. I believe that all corporations
engaged in interstate commerce should be
under the supervision of the National
Government. I do not believe in taking
steps hastily or rashly, and it may be that
all that is necessary in the immediate future
is to pass an interstate-commerce bill conferring<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
upon some branch of the executive
government the power of effective action to
remedy the abuses in connection with railway
transportation. But in the end, and in
my judgment at a time not very far off, we
shall have to, or at least we shall find that
we ought to, take further action as regards
all corporations doing interstate business.
The enormous increase in interstate trade,
resulting from the industrial development
of the last quarter of a century, makes
it proper that the Federal Government<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
should, so far as may be necessary to
carry into effect its national policy, assume
a degree of administrative control of these
great corporations.</p>

<p>It may well be that we shall find that
the only effective way of exercising this
supervision is to require all corporations
engaged in interstate commerce to produce
proof satisfactory, say, to the Department
of Commerce, that they are not
parties to any contract or combination or
engaged in any monopoly in interstate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
trade in violation of the anti-trust law,
and that their conduct on certain other
specified points is proper; and, moreover,
that these corporations shall agree, with a
penalty of forfeiture of their right to engage
in such commerce, to furnish any
evidence of any kind as to their trade
between the States whenever so required
by the Department of Commerce.</p>

<p>It is the almost universal policy of the
several States, provided by statute, that
foreign corporations may lawfully conduct<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
business within their boundaries only
when they produce certificates that they
have complied with the requirements of
their respective States; in other words,
that corporations shall not enjoy the
privileges and immunities afforded by
the State governments without first complying
with the policy of their laws.
Now the benefits which corporations engaged
in interstate trade enjoy under the
United States Government are incalculable;
and in respect of such trade the jurisdiction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
of the Federal Government is supreme
when it chooses to exercise it.</p>

<p>When, as is now the case, many of
the great corporations consistently strain
the last resources of legal technicality to
avoid obedience to a law for the reasonable
regulation of their business, the only
way effectively to meet this attitude on
their part is to give to the Executive
Department of the Government a more
direct and therefore more efficient supervision
and control of their management.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span></p>

<p>In speaking against the abuses committed
by certain very wealthy corporations or
individuals, and of the necessity of seeking
so far as it can safely be done to remedy
these abuses, there is always danger
lest what is said may be misinterpreted as
an attack upon men of means generally.
Now it can not too often be repeated in a
Republic like ours that the only way by
which it is possible permanently to benefit
the condition of the less able and less
fortunate, is so to shape our policy that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
all industrious and efficient people who
act decently may be benefited; and this
means, of course, that the benefit will come
even more to the more able and more
fortunate. If, under such circumstances,
the less fortunate man is moved by envy
of his more fortunate brother to strike at
the conditions under which they have both,
though unequally, prospered, he may rest
assured that while the result may be damaging
to the other man, it will be even
more damaging to himself. Of course, I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
am now speaking of prosperity that comes
under normal and proper conditions.</p>

<p>In our industrial and social system the
interests of all men are so closely intertwined
that in the immense majority of
cases the straight-dealing man who by
ingenuity and industry benefits himself
must also benefit others. The man of
great productive capacity who gets rich
through guiding the labor of hundreds or
thousands of other men does so, as a rule,
by enabling their labor to produce more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
than it would without his guidance, and
both he and they share in the benefit, so
that even if the share be unequal it must
never be forgotten that they too are really
benefited by his success.</p>

<p>A vital factor in the success of any
enterprise is the guiding intelligence of
the man at the top, and there is need in
the interest of all of us to encourage
rather than to discourage the activity of
the exceptional men who guide average
men so that their labor may result in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
increased production of the kind which
is demanded at the time. Normally we
help the wage-worker, we help the man of
small means, by making conditions such
that the man of exceptional business
ability receives an exceptional reward for
that ability.</p>

<p>But while insisting with all emphasis
upon this, it is also true that experience
has shown that when there is no governmental
restraint or supervision, some of
the exceptional men use their energies,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
not in ways that are for the common good,
but in ways which tell against this common
good; and that by so doing they not
only wrong smaller and less able men—whether
wage-workers or small producers
and traders—but force other men of exceptional
abilities themselves to do what is
wrong under penalty of falling behind in
the keen race for success. There is need
of legislation to strive to meet such abuses.
At one time or in one place this legislation
may take the form of factory laws<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
and employers’ liability laws. Under
other conditions it may take the form of
dealing with the franchises which derive
their value from the grant of the representatives
of the people. It may be aimed at
the manifold abuses, far-reaching in their
effects, which spring from overcapitalization.
Or it may be necessary to meet
such conditions as those with which I am
now dealing and to strive to procure
proper supervision and regulation by the
National Government of all great corporations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
engaged in interstate commerce
or doing an interstate business.</p>

<p>There are good people who are afraid
of each type of legislation; and much the
same kind of argument that is now advanced
against the effort to regulate big
corporations has been again and again
advanced against the effort to secure
proper employers’ liability laws or proper
factory laws with reference to women and
children; much the same kind of argument
was advanced but five years ago<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
against the franchise-tax law enacted in
this State while I was governor.</p>

<p>Of course there is always the danger
of abuse if legislation of this type is approached
in a hysterical or sentimental
spirit, or, above all, if it is approached in
a spirit of envy and hatred toward men
of wealth.</p>

<p>We must not try to go too fast, under
penalty of finding that we may be going
in the wrong direction; and in any event,
we ought always to proceed by evolution<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
and not by revolution. The laws
must be conceived and executed in a
spirit of sanity and justice, and with exactly
as much regard for the rights of
the big man as for the rights of the little
man—treating big man and little man
exactly alike.</p>

<p>Our ideal must be the effort to combine
all proper freedom for individual effort
with some guarantee that the effort is not
exercised in contravention of the eternal
and immutable principles of justice.</p>
